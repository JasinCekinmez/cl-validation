# Goal 

The goal of my code and research is to analyze the completeness of two administrative datasets and then to create a model that predicts house prices based on the clean data and variables. 

--`TibbleCreator()` serves the purpose of returning tables that show the completeness for various columns in different counties, states, years, etc. 

--`LollipopCreator()` looks at the completeness for arms and non arms lengths 

--`PlotMaker()` visualizes the data geographically on a map 

--`Slurmmake(STATE)` creates a hedonic model for a specific state 

--`Lollipop2.0(list)` creates a lollipop graph for various columns in the tax dataset by comparing arms length vs everything

I hope that these functions make your analysis and predictions smoother!
